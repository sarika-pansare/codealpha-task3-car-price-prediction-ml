(Task 3 ‚Äì CodeAlpha Data Science Internship)


üìÑ Project Overview
       The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the price of a car based on its various features such as engine size, horsepower, car brand, fuel type, and more. This is part of the CodeAlpha Data              Science Internship. We use machine learning techniques to model the relationship between car features and their market price.


üß† Key Learning Outcomes
       Understanding how to preprocess and clean data for machine learning tasks.

       Building a regression model using Linear Regression and evaluating its performance.

       Visualizing the relationship between car features and price using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

       Gaining insights into which car attributes influence the price the most.


üìù Problem Statement
       In the automobile industry, knowing how to predict car prices based on their features can be immensely valuable. Car dealers, buyers, and sellers often need to determine a fair market price for a used or new car. This project          applies machine learning to predict car prices based on attributes such as engine size, horsepower, and brand.


üîß Tech Stack
      Python: Programming language for data processing and modeling.

      Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

      NumPy: For numerical operations and handling data arrays.

      Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

      Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

      Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and experimentation.


üß© Data Exploration & Preprocessing
       The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of cars, such as their engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and car brand. The key preprocessing steps include:

       Data Cleaning: Removing any irrelevant columns like car_ID and CarName and converting CarName to the CarBrand.

       One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format to make them usable for machine learning models.

       Feature Extraction: Extracting car brands from the CarName column.

       Data Splitting: Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).



üèóÔ∏è Model Building
       We used Linear Regression to predict the car price based on the following features:

       TV: Advertising expenditure on TV (Not relevant for car price, but part of the dataset).

       Radio: Advertising expenditure on radio.

       Newspaper: Advertising expenditure on newspapers.

      The model learns the relationship between these features and the target variable, price.



üßÆ Model Evaluation
       After training the model, we evaluated its performance using:

       R¬≤ Score: This metric helps determine how well the model explains the variance in the target variable (car price).

       Mean Squared Error (MSE): This helps assess the difference between the actual and predicted prices. A lower MSE indicates better performance.
     

üìä Visualization
       Actual vs Predicted Prices: A scatter plot was used to visualize how close the predicted prices were to the actual car prices. The ideal scenario is when all the points lie on the diagonal line.

        Feature Correlation: We visualized how different features correlate with the car price, helping us understand which features impact the price most.


üìà Insights
       Engine Size and Horsepower had the highest correlation with car price, meaning these features heavily influenced the predicted price.

       The model performed fairly well with an R¬≤ score of about 0.88 (this is subject to change depending on the data split and training).

       Outliers in the dataset, such as luxury cars or sports cars, impacted the model‚Äôs accuracy, suggesting that a more advanced model like Random Forest could be more effective.


üîÆ Future Improvements
        Advanced Models: Using models like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) could lead to better results, as these models handle non-linear relationships and feature importance better.

        More Features: Adding more data points, such as car mileage, year of manufacture, or transmission type, could provide better predictions.

        Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV to tune model hyperparameters could increase model performance.

       Web Deployment: The model could be deployed using Flask or Streamlit to allow users to input car details and predict the price in real-time.
